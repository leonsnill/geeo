    "Remote sensing plays an extraordinarily important role in ecological and biogeographic research and monitoring, such as in assessing biodiversity and habitat state and dynamics (Pereira et al. 2013). The spectral imagery recorded from Earth Observation (EO) satellites either directly measures or proxies a variety of biophysical properties that could otherwise not be measured as consistently across space and time. Medium spatial resolution imagery (~10-100m), as provided by the Landsat and Sentinel-2 missions, offers systematically collected, standardized, and quality assessed (predominantly radiometry and geometry) multispectral time series at unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage and density. As such, Landsat and Sentinel-2 allow for deriving a wide range of essential products needed for studying the Biosphere, including—for example—land cover (LC) and LC change, disturbance regimes (e.g., fire), and vegetation condition and phenology (Radeloff et al. 2024). Although global, standardized products are also becoming increasingly available at medium spatial resolution, there is equally great demand for regional products and research-tailored image analyses (Tulbure et al. 2022), particularly when attempting to bridge the gap between field-based ecological monitoring and remote sensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tailoring the image processing to specific research questions requires, to some extent, specialized knowledge in image processing and earth observation methods. When data volumes become large because broad-scale and long- and dense time series are needed, it can create an additional barrier for non-experts in remote sensing. The earth observation community has developed established preprocessing and feature generation routines for these cases, yet their accessibility to applied ecologists and biogeographers could be improved. Simultaneously, access to a standardized workflow would generally enhance efficiency - including for acquainted remote sensing users—particularly for recurring (pre-)processing steps underpinning a variety of applied EO methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of this notebook is to illustrate the capabilities of geeo in supporting geographical and ecological research that makes use of medium resolution multispectral imagery along worked examples. Specifically, we will illustrate how geeo can support the processing and exporting of various data products that have been used in past research.**\n",

    "Multispectral imagery is considered a usefull predictor of habitat conditions and dynamics, since vegetation productivity proxies (food) resources availability. \n",
    "As such, continuous spectral features derived from optical remote sensing, that in turn measure productivity (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), are frequently used in to characterise habitat and serve as inputs for SDMs. Different relationships between ecological process and specral measure have been established to study biodiversity. Fairly popular are the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) (e.g. Radeloff et al. 2019; Razenkova et al. 2025) that measure vegetation productivity and seasonality from vegetation indices. Similarily, Oeser et al. (2019) characterize different aspects of wildlife habitat - including productivity, phenology, openness, moisture and snow cover - based on multitemporal multispectral Landsat data in order to map habitat suitability for lynx, red deer, and roe deer in the Bohemian forests of Germany and the Czech Republic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite various nomenclature and ecological semantics, these approaches essentially use what the remote sensing community refers to as 'multitemporal spectral metrics' or 'Spectral-Temporal-Metrics' (STMs). **STMs are a commonly applied form of dimensionality reduction in remote sensing, in which pixel-wise statistics across individual bands/features are calculated for a given set of imagery over time.** For example, one could estimate the average productivity within the growing season based on the NDVI by calculating the pixel-wise statistical average of all NDVI values observed within the defined time period. STMs are popular because they collapse potential high dimensional data (time series) into fewer metrics that if properly selected represent similar amount of information variance/conten, while also solving a ubiquitous problem of optical imagery: gaps in the imagery due to quality masking (e.g., clouds). As such, **STMs are fairly robust and spatially continuous features required for gap-free image analyses such as habitat or land cover mapping**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this first example, we are going to translate the remote sensing methodology of deriving habitat metrics from Landsat to GEEO** which could underpin similar research conducted in our study area. We will partly orientate the image processing workflow along the methodology by Oeser et al. (2019). In their paper, they combine different spectral features that proxy different aspects of land surface or habitat conditions with various intra-annual time windows that represent different phenological stages and thus seasonal ressource availability. In summary, they use all available Landsat imagery between 2011 and 2013 covering their study area and mask out all observations containing clouds, cloud shadows or snow using the the Pixel-Quality Assessment (QA) band. They calculate three main features from the multspectral bands of Landsat: the Tasseled Cap greenness (TCG), brightness (TCB) and wetness (TCW). TCG proxies photosynthetically active vegetation, TCB proxies the soil component and thus certain types of open habitat, and TCW proxies moisture, including soil and vegetation water content. Based on the TCG, TCB, and TCW time series, they derive a set of STMs (median, interquartile-range, etc.) for different seasonal windows (start-of-season DOY 60-151; peak-of-season DOY 152-243, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining the settings for the habitat metric calculation**\n",
    "- We want to capture average conditions of last three years: 2022-2024\n",
    "- We want to differentiate between spring (Mar-May), summer (Jun-Aug) and autumn (Sep-Nov), and winter (Dec-Feb) season\n",
    "- We will include all available Landsat-8 to Landsat-9 data with <75% cloud cover and mask all non-clear, invalid pixels except for snow\n",
    "- We will use the same spectral features as Oeser et al., i.e. TCG, TCB, and TCW (since they have the advantage of using the full multispectral spectrum recorded from Landsat)\n",
    "- We will calculate the following STMs for each season and feature combination: the median, 10% and 90% percentiles, and standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our defined criteria for deriving the metrics, we can now move on to how to translate these conditions into processing instructions for geeo. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying the processing instructions in GEEO\n",
    "Because it is easier to illustrate the workflow in this notebook using the dictionary approach, we are going to specify the instructions directly here in a code chunk using a python dictionary instead of creating .yml parameter file. Here is the table of all parameters we should set in order to create a Spectral-Temporal-Metric (STM) ee.ImageCollection that matches our definitions from above:"

    "## Exporting the image data\n",
    "Often we would like to export data to Drive or as an Asset. If we are requesting an export from Earth Engine (via geeo), we either directly or indirectly specify metadata associated with the export. For example, an image export requires a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), spatial extent (defined by ROI), and pixel resolution (called 'scale' in GEE) to be set. In plain GEE, the user must at least specify the region and scale (pixel resolution) for the export to work, but this means all other metadata and precise CRS information are inferred. It is generally good practise to be explicit about the metadata and the CRS. \n",
    "\n",
    "geeo encourages being explicit and allows full control on specific metadata, for example, the CRS transform and image dimensions (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/exporting_images). At the same time, geeo can handle precisely aligning CRS grids etc. for the user. That means, by default it will align the output extent (precisely) to the input ROI. Read more on tiling schemes and CRS here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we use a 150x150km tile that defines our study area. In this case we know it is projected in a specific CRS following the GLANCE tiling scheme (https://measures-glance.github.io/glance-grids/). geeo knows these continent specific CRS (EU, NA, SA, AF, AS, OC) and we can thus specify \"CRS: EU\" in our parameter settings. Furthermore, we are working with Landsat data that predominantly records with a 30m spatial resolution which we intend to keep. Since our process involves many Landsat scenes, each stored in potentially different UTM CRSs, and we intend to reproject to the EU GLANCE CRS, we would like to use bilinear resampling as spatial interpolation method for our continuous spectral data (instead of nearest neighbour). To store data more efficiently, we accept the standard settings of scaling our data by a value of 10,000 and saving the resulting scaled data using the signed integer 16 data type (instead of floating point). Invalid, or missing pixels should be set to -9999. Last, we specify that we would like to export image products in general, and the STM in particular. We further specify the location to Asset and the associated directory within the Assets:"

    "In this section we are going to create a Time Series Interpolation (TSI) from our Landsat Time Series Stack (TSS). With STMs we already learned how to reduce the inconsistent, gappy time-series of different density into a continuous image product suitable, for example, for mapping exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second example, we will derive a Time Series Interpolation (TSI) product from a Landsat-based Time Series Stack (TSS) using a double Radial Basis Function (‘Gaussian’) interpolation. Many applications use interpolated spectral time series, including, for example, assessments of land-use intensity (Rufin et al., 2019) or characterisiation of land surface phenology (Kowalski et al., 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "TSIs uses interpolation methods to create a gap-free, equidistant time series which can be usefull for applications that require these attributes, i.e. when gappy, non-equidistant and fluctuating data densities directly impact the analysis. TSI can help suppress undesired variance (or noise) and allows for uninflated calculations of image features such as Spectral-Temporal-Metrics (Nill et al., 2022).\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure a gap-free, equidistant time series which captures the reflectance dynamics smoothly, yet also is robust to potential outliers, a common interpolation method uses a Radial-Basis-Function (RBF) or Gaussian kernel. This interpolation method is a convolution, so no function fitting is applied, but instead the Gaussian function acts as a moving window averaging. The RBF kernel 'moves' over the desired equidistant time steps, and the original observations (e.g. Time Series Stack (TSS)) are weighted according to a Gaussian distribution. \n",

Specifically, we illustrate this in the context of large-area land cover mapping analogously to the methodology described by Pflugmacher et al., (2019). In this paper, the authors use the LUCAS 'Land use and land cover' survey reference dataset in combination with multispectral Landsat-8 data to map pan-European land cover for the year 2015.\n",

We then used the data to derive a large variety of Spectral-Temporal-Metrics (STMs) which in turn served as features in Random Forest classification modelling. We then uploaded the final model to Earth Engine which allows for predicting twelve land-cover classes. We describe the overarching steps and provide links to the Python files implementing the methods, but focus on the main outputs and results in this notebook."

    "## LUCAS - Land use and land cover survey\n",
    "The Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) is a harmonised, in situ survey conducted across the entire European Union (EU) to provide comparable statistics on land use and land cover. LUCAS collects field-based observations using a standardised methodology, enabling the study of socio-environmental challenges such as land take, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss. Land cover describes the physical characteristics of the land (e.g., forests, water, buildings), while land use refers to how land is utilised (e.g., agriculture, residential, recreation). Land cover is classified in a total of 8 categories, 29 classes and 76 subclasses. Pflugmacher et al. (2019) differentiate between 12 land cover classes:\n",
