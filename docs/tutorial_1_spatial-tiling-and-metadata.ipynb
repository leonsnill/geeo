    "Google Earth Engine hides much of the underlying complexities for mass-processing geospatial data, including spatial data organization in general, and proejctions in particular. *\"[Earth Engine is designed so that you rarely have to worry about map projections when doing computations.](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/projections)\"*. This is comfortable, but also bears its risks. In case you are coding in GEE yourself, we highly recommend getting familiar with the concepts of [scale](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale), [projections](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/projections), and [resampling](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/resample). **Geeo does potentially necessary spatial metadata handling for you within its core processing routine.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is generally no need in GEE to specify a projection for instructing computations (with a few exceptions), and many of the spatial metadata and processing can simply be inferred or set to default settings (e.g. EPSG:4326 for crs), it is generally good practise to be explicit about these settings and being aware of the influence they can have. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "**When triggering an export, the following settings should ideally be explicitly set:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **pixel resolution** (termed ['scale'](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale) in GEE):\n",
    "- The **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** or 'projection'\n",
    "- The **resampling method**: By default, Nearest Neighbour (NN) resampling is used if neither 'bilinear' or 'bicubic' are specified.\n",
    "- The **Region Of Interest (ROI)** or spatial extent/bounding box of the output image\n",
    "\n",
    "In geeo, these are either set in the parameter .yml-file / dictionary (`PIX_RES`, `CRS`, `RESAMPLING_METHOD`, `ROI`) or when using the auxiliary function `export_img()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, the user can also precisely define the affine transform (`CRS_TRANSFORM`) to use for the export, as well as the image dimensions (`IMG_DIMENSIONS`). Note from the GEE docs: *\"to get a block of pixels precisely aligned to another data source, specify dimensions, crs and crsTransform.\"*. Geeo can handle precisely aligning the pixels onto a desired grid based on the `ROI` (more on this below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Tiling\n",
    "**Geeo has in-built functions for creating a spatial tiling scheme for a given CRS.** This faciliates spatial organization of the data similar to the datacube concept and allows precisely aligning output images onto a grid scheme. Especially when working with long and/or dense time series, as well as when working with different geospatial raster datasets in a given region, spatial tiling schemes can be extremely usefull.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grid:** The spatial, regular division of the space into tiles starting the grid origin.\n",
    "- **Grid Origin:** Upper left corner coordinate where numbering of tiles start in X and Y direction\n",
    "- **Tile:** A (square) grid cell covering an area defined by the tile size. Associated with a unique identifier (X000_Y0000).\n",
    "- **Tile Size:** The n times n size in meters covered by a tile.\n"
