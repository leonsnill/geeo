    "This introductory tutorial provides an overview on the basic structure and usage of **geeo**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**geeo** is a processing pipeline and collection of algorithms for obtaining Analysis-Ready-Data (ARD) and higher-level image products from multispectral image archives, including the Landsat and Sentinel-2 archive, using the Google Earth Engine Python API. \n",
    "The processing modules are organized along different hierarchical levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LEVEL-2 (`geeo/level2`): Preprocessed, harmonized, spatio-temporally subsetted surface reflectance time series stacks (TSS) and mosaics (TSM)   \n",
    "- LEVEL-3 (`geeo/level3`): Advanced spectral features including Spectral-Temporal-Metrics (STM) and Pixel-based Composits (PBC), as well as time series interpolation (TSI)\n",
    "- LEVEL-4 (`geeo/level4`): Semantic features, i.e. information derived from spectral signals. Currently implemented in workflow are Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics. An auxiliary machine learning module allows to upload local compatible scikit-learn models to an ee.Classifier.   \n",
    "- EXPORT (`geeo/export`): Export module handling metadata and projection settings, and constructing export tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the user does not directly interact with the submodules, but simply provides processing instructions defined via either a text file (.yml) or python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic - but not limited to - approach to use **geeo** is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a .yml parameter file from an existing blueprint using the `create_parameter_file()` function\n",
    "2. Adjust the parameter settings in the .yml file to your requirements\n",
    "3. Running the adjusted parameter file using `run_param()` to trigger the processing\n",
    "4. Either export the data to Drive/Asset (if specified in parameter file) or use the resulting ee objects in your interactive python session\n",
